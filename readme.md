# OpenCV Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Scope / OpenCV CSGO Scope

I Still am no good at this game. I thought it was good to be able to AWP with a SMG or an M4A4. a sniper has a scope but an SMG or a Rifle does not. I thought it would be good to make my own scope using OpenCV. This is my humble attempt at it. This is a simple one day project.
